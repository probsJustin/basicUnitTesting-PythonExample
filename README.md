# basicUnitTesting-PythonExample
Basic unit testing for teaching and explaining unit testing. 

This does not follow assert but is an example of using returnable objects/classes that wrap the return and add a "true/false" to it to allow 
for it to always have some kind of testing built into the function - this is not a standard and is not always useful in every case.
